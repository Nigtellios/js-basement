/* Debugging is the process of going though your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. */

/* Issues in code generally come in three forms: SYNTAX ERRORS (that prevent your program from running), RUNTIME ERRORS (where your code has unexpected behavior), or LOGICAL ERRORS (where your code doesn't do what you intended. */

/* In this part of course, you will learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen. */
