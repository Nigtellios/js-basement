/* Debugging is the process of going though your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. */

/* Issues in code generally come in three forms: SYNTAX ERRORS (that prevent your program from running), RUNTIME ERRORS (where your code has unexpected behavior), or LOGICAL ERRORS (where your code doesn't do what you intended. */

/* In this part of course, you will learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen. */

/* Task D1: Use JS Console to Check the Value of a Variable */

/* Every browser has Developer consoles, also known as DevTools, you can debug your JS there. */

/* The console.log method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is. */

/* Let's use some console.log! */

/* OUTPUT CODE */
console.log(`Task D1, yes, we are using console logs.`);
