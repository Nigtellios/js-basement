# js-basement

<h2>Description:</h2> </br>
This is the place where I am posting all my non-project-related tasks which I'm doing in my free time to refresh knowledge from JavaScript. Some of them would have their visual representation, while rest is switched-off for code archive purposes. (Ready-to-go JS file is attached at the bottom of <body> tag in index.html file.)
