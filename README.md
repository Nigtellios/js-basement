# js-basement

<h2>Description:</h2> </br>
This is the place where I am posting all my non-project-related tasks which I'm doing in my free time to refresh knowledge from JavaScript. Some of them would have their visual representation, while rest is switched-off for code archive purposes. (Ready-to-go JS file is attached at the bottom of <body> tag in index.html file.)

<h2>Development notes:</h2>
After 22.04.2021 I'm no longer uploading tasks into HTML Files.

This approach simply takes too much time and would be better to re-write it to some kind of CRUD application where I could upload any task.

At this moment, **everything after FreeCodeCamp's Regular Expression Module isn't uploaded to HTML.** If you want to check what I've done after that, you can do it inside:

```js
'/js/tasks/fcc-js-<module-name>'
```
