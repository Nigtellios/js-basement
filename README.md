# js-basement

<h2>Description:</h2> </br>
This is the place where I am posting all my non-project-related tasks which I'm doing in my free time to refresh knowledge from JavaScript. Some of them would have their visual representation, while rest is switched-off for code archive purposes. (Ready-to-go JS file is attached at the bottom of <body> tag in index.html file.)

<h2>Structure:</h2> </br>
Simple project structure with Webpack 5 Boilerplate.

<h2>How to run it:</h2> </br>
Download *.zip, unpack it and run index.html via your browser inside project folder. It can be run without local server (there are only html, css and JS files and always will be).
